            <h3 class="centered">Cutting With and Without Masks</h3>
            <p>The purpose of cutting acrylic with masks is to have all burn marks be on the mask, which can then promptly be removed. On the bottom, you get scorch marks, from when the laser penetrates too far and vaporizes the vector grid underneath the acrylic. If cutting with a mask, the bottom mask is the one you always want.</p>

                        <p>The top mask is only required when cutting small things (smaller than a 1/4" hole). If the top mask is not left on, you get marks around the cut like shown in the picture to the left. However, these marks are not the end of the world, they can only be seen under certain light angles, however, they do detract from the aesthetics.</p>

            <p>The downside to cutting with masks on comes apparent when cutting many small parts. It is difficult and very time consuming to remove the masks from say 150 tiny circles without fingernails of literal steel (I speak from experience). Thus, when cutting many small parts, it is advisable to cut without a mask.</p>
            <p>The downside to cutting without masks is somewhat shown in the image above. On the bottom, there will be some scorch marks, and on the top you get heat marks. Scorch marks can be very eaisly cleaned off with isopropoyl (spelling?) alcohol, however, the heat marks will presist unless you sand them off, which many leave scratch marks unless you are careful.</p>

                        <p>Engraving or Etching can also be done with a mask or without a mask. Engraving with a mask requires more power and a tiny bit of post processing. Engraving without a mask requires lower power and no post processing. It may seem like engraving without a mask is the better way to go, but that increases your post processing if you cut afterwards.</p>
