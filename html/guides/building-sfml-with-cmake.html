            <br>
            
            <p>So I was having an absurd number of issues building SFML from the source code with CMake. I managed to figure it out after a few days, and I realized that the <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/compile-with-cmake.php">online guide</a> does not do a good job of explaining things if you are a complete noob at compiling libraries and have no idea what CMake is. Therefore, you have this guide.</p>
            
            <h3 class="centered">What do you need?</h3>
            
            <div class="page">
                <div class="page-left-box-flipped">
                    <ul>
                        <li>The source code of SFML. This can be found on their website under the download tab. Click on the top left button (Latest stable  version), then download the Source Code.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Then, just extract the zip file into an easily accessible location, like "C:\" or your desktop</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <li>CMake GUI. Go to CMake's <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">downloads page</a> and download the proper version of CMake for your OS. Note that on Windows, x86 means 32 bit, x64 means 64 bit. If you don't know what your Windows install is, Google how to find out.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is helpful but not necessary to add CMake to the system PATH variable. If you don't know what that is, try googling it :)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="page-right-box-flipped">
                    <p>image</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="page">

                    <p>image</p>
                </div>      
                <div class="page-right-box-large">
                    <div class="page-right-center-box">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some sort of C++ compiler. I suggest using TDM-GCC (because that's what I used and it works). Again, go to their <a href="http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download">downloads page</a> and pick up whatever version you want. If you don't know and don't care, click on the first download link. If you don't know but do care, google is your friend.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>BUT, if you have a compiler installed already, it's a-ok to use that one as well.</li>
                                <li>If you are installing TDM-GCC version whatever, just create a new install with all the default values</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>

                        <li>The first thing you want to do in CMake is find the source code.</li>
