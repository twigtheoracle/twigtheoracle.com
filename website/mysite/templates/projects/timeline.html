        <p>I have for as long as I can remember, had an awful memory for things that I have done and things that have happened to me. This project is my attempt to record my history including past, present, and future events. Not included on this list are more mundane events, which to me include things like parties, eating out, etc.</p>

        <p>The project was started on August 23rd, 2022. Events that occurred many years before this date (or to be honest, even a few months before this date) are likely the result of research rather than recollection.</p>

        <p>This project is still heavily work in progress.</p>
