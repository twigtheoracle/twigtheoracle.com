                    <p>Highly anticipated 2nd full blown album lengthening hour and 16 minutes in 19 tracks, that in no way are tiring, each and every track gives its best and wants to show something. There really isn't the same idea made twice here, which for some might actually be bad, as some of these songs are so beautifully made, so catchy with their choruses and bridges that I just wish for more of it, but then immediately on the next song I do get more, but plated in a different way. Listening to Hornet Disaster is by no means a chore, each track makes me excited about the next, and each track feeling like they belong here, which is crazy, as Sputnik mentioned, there were already 70 tracks made for this, and only then they realized that this project will be about hornets. Which at first might seem kinda random, but with the lyrics and topics that seem to mention going through a breakup of some sort and all the things after it, the title Hornet Disaster doesn't seem that crazy after. It's an album about someones disaster. </p>

                    <p>Going back to the more sound sphere of this project, simply put, there are moments where you can relax, think things through but it's just a calm before a storm, as this albums main thing, similarly to Sputniks previous hardwork Come In is to blast as much sound at you, either from guitars, vocals or some synths or something I don't know that much about music, further comparing to their previous stuff, Hornet Disaster is I think the most catchy out of all three Weatherday projects, especially in the first half, with those memorable shouts like "Like an angel, in the shape of an angel", "When you say things like “What the hell” What I hear is “Take care of yourself”" or "Nostalgia drive avatar, That is me, That is me" any many many more, like really many I dont think it would be crazy to say, each song has that one moment that just went crazy, and it doesn't want to let go of my brain. Hornet Disaster is a crazy project, that because of its noisy nature, won’t please every ear, but mine are sooo pleased, like I cannot stop listening to this to the point where Im afraid I might get tired of it.</p>

                    <p><b>Sunbather Perfected</b></p>

                    <p>This album is much more than what can be boiled down in a regular 3 paragraph review. Combined with the fact that I can’t adequately describe my feelings when listening to this kind of metal, it will lead to a pretty awkward review. Instead, a top-down approach will better divulge my emotional state before and after the album. Sunbather is a powerful album, and Deafheaven has interested me in their journey ever since. However, I think they may have one-upped themselves even from that pinnacle. Things are streamlined to glorious perfection. No huge post-rock pieces are breaking up the album flow here. Instead, the post-rock elements are baked into specific stretches of songs here and there. This adds a unique and special twist where every song reaches the stars in mesmerizing crescendos. Intense compositions, striking instrumentation, and straightforward riffs give this album a clean edge. All of this is executed while maintaining a heavy and abrasive atmosphere. </p>

                    <p>Lonely People with Power excels at doing all the right things within smaller confines. The black metal influence is direct, and the album's flow is unbreakable. The band delivers an adrenaline shot within almost every song here. It is packed full of the themes of loneliness and self-hatred—but, in the same breath, narcissism. Not to mention, all-time tracks for the band land here, like “Winona,” “Body Behavior,” and “Amethyst.” Even a track like “The Garden Route,” in its simplicity, really stands out for the dynamics it incorporates. The album also sticks an immaculate ending with “The Marvelous Orange Tree.” The vocals cascade into joy and sorrow, ebbing and flowing through the cosmos. The pain and beauty in the descriptions through the perspective of our protagonist are profound. The religious imagery of God giving a wish to the character at the very end instills a sense of reverence for the life we get to live here and now. Whether you’re alone in life or not, we’re all human and have been through that feeling before. I assure you, you’re not alone. </p>

                    <p>In conclusion, this is undoubtedly a contender for album of the year, and I'm glad I gave this an honest try. Smaller moments take me away from the experience (i.e., the pacing of “Incidental II” or the vocal delivery of some softer vocal passages). These moments are tiny and never take away from the total composition being built up from the immense momentum this album picks up almost instantly. Vocal features are incorporated tastefully and added to bring something meaningful to the table of the more significant project. Altogether, I find this album more appealing than even Sunbather. There’s room for it to bloom into one of my favorite black gaze/metal records, period. </p>

                    <p>Genre: Post Rock, Art Rock<br>Release Date: March 1st, 2025<br>My Rating: 4.5/5</p>

                    <p>Review by <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~sarkist173">sarkist173</a></p>

                    <p>I enjoyed the split record from Canut de Bon and Cóclea; it was a refreshing blast of post-hardcore and noise rock that I wish was replicated a bit more in modern punk. Canut de Bon’s contributions were especially exhilarating and powerful. Now, they’ve come out with a new album, though this time it's a mix of members from both bands under one group: Hesse Kassel. They’ve assembled themselves for La Brea, a near 80-minute blast of post-rock. The members still keep a handle on their post-hardcore and punk influences but translate them into nuanced, subtle, yet theatrical rock compositions and soundscapes. The result is a good, at points great, and even more occasionally beautiful album. However, it does suffer from some drawbacks of being fairly derivative of modern trends in underground rock music. </p>

                    <p>The one thing that I can commend this album for is how it handles the builds between the climaxes. It really takes its time, letting each of the instruments develop their character and flesh out their contributions to the soundscape before sweeping them all together for a crescendo. They complement each other throughout its runtime, and more often than not I find them more infectious and enjoyable than I would otherwise. It’s excellent musicianship, and Renatto Olivares’ passionate, stage-ready sing-talking was captivating and contributed to it all quite well. There are heavy jazz influences on this album; from the structures and compositions to the instrumentation, it enriches the experience quite a lot. On top of that, the album is solid from start to finish, with excellent sequencing making Yo La Tengo and A Latur a fittingly explosive one-two punch conclusion. The issues that I have with the record largely lie in that it’s nothing that special. It’s not doing something new that other acts like Isaac Wood-era BCNR, Maruja, and Squid haven’t done already. Admittedly, it does what it does, very, very well. Hell, I enjoyed this much more than Cowards, thanks to Renatto’s vocals and the timbres being given time to develop. But I can’t shake the feeling that I've been here before. Despite that, La Brea is still a great rock record and a good showcase for the flexibility and versatility of the musicians behind it. </p>
