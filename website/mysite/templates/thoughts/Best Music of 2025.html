                    <p>Genre: Post Rock, Art Rock<br>Release Date: March 1, 2025<br>My Rating: 4.5/5</p>

                    <p>Review by <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~sarkist173">sarkist173</a></p>

                    <p>I enjoyed the split record from Canut de Bon and Cóclea; it was a refreshing blast of post-hardcore and noise rock that I wish was replicated a bit more in modern punk. Canut de Bon’s contributions were especially exhilarating and powerful. Now, they’ve come out with a new album, though this time it's a mix of members from both bands under one group: Hesse Kassel. They’ve assembled themselves for La Brea, a near 80-minute blast of post-rock. The members still keep a handle on their post-hardcore and punk influences but translate them into nuanced, subtle, yet theatrical rock compositions and soundscapes. The result is a good, at points great, and even more occasionally beautiful album. However, it does suffer from some drawbacks of being fairly derivative of modern trends in underground rock music. </p>

                    <p>The one thing that I can commend this album for is how it handles the builds between the climaxes. It really takes its time, letting each of the instruments develop their character and flesh out their contributions to the soundscape before sweeping them all together for a crescendo. They complement each other throughout its runtime, and more often than not I find them more infectious and enjoyable than I would otherwise. It’s excellent musicianship, and Renatto Olivares’ passionate, stage-ready sing-talking was captivating and contributed to it all quite well. There are heavy jazz influences on this album; from the structures and compositions to the instrumentation, it enriches the experience quite a lot. On top of that, the album is solid from start to finish, with excellent sequencing making Yo La Tengo and A Latur a fittingly explosive one-two punch conclusion. The issues that I have with the record largely lie in that it’s nothing that special. It’s not doing something new that other acts like Isaac Wood-era BCNR, Maruja, and Squid haven’t done already. Admittedly, it does what it does, very, very well. Hell, I enjoyed this much more than Cowards, thanks to Renatto’s vocals and the timbres being given time to develop. But I can’t shake the feeling that I've been here before. Despite that, La Brea is still a great rock record and a good showcase for the flexibility and versatility of the musicians behind it. </p>
