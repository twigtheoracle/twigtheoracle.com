            <p>Since May of 2022, I have tried to go to at least one concert a month, up to as many as one concert per week. I have always loved listening to music and I have no idea why I ended up not going to concerts until so late in my life.</p>

            <p>Each concert (the full list of which and venues can be found in the <a href="/projects/timeline">Timeline</a>) typically has 2-3 artists, of which I rate those I remember.</p>

            <p>A few other things to note:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Most of the artists I have only seen live once. If this is not the case, it will be noted in paratheses the number of times I have seen them live.</li>
                <li>In some concerts, either the venue or the audience detracted enough from the experience to lower them a tier. This is noted by a small downward arrow (<span>&#8595;</span>) next to the artist.</li>
                <li>If the venue or audience significantly detracted enough from the experience, this will be noted by a double small downward arrow (<span>&#8595;</span><span>&#8595;</span>) next to the artist.</li>
                <li>If an artist has a comma in the name, their name will be quoted.</li>
            </ol>
